The name of the application is 'Developer Finder'. We suggest you follow the naming convention below when creating your instance of the application:

​  **developer-finder-[suffix]**

The suffix is used to avoid Azure resource naming conflicts. 

> **IMPORTANT NOTE: Only use lowercase letters (a-z), numbers (0-9), and hyphens (-).  Uppercase letters will cause errors to occur.**

Below are some examples:

* developer-finder-contoso (company name is used)
* developer-finder-0901-1200 (date and time are used)

In this document, we use the first example to show you how to deploy the solution to Azure. When you are finished with the deployment, you will be able to browse to the web application by navigating to this URL in a web browser:

> https://developer-finder-[suffix].azurewebsites.net
